"The sun was shining on the sea,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊShining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThe billows smooth and bright Ñ
And this was odd, because it was
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThe middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊBecause she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAfter the day was done Ñ
"It's very rude of him," she said,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"To come and spoil the fun."
The sea was wet as wet could be,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThe sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
ÊÊÊÊÊÊNo cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead Ñ
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThere were no birds to fly.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
ÊÊÊÊÊÊWere walking close at hand;
They wept like anything to see
ÊÊÊÊÊÊSuch quantities of sand:
If this were only cleared away,"
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThey said, "it would be grand!"
"If seven maids with seven mops
ÊÊÊÊÊÊSwept it for half a year,
Do you suppose," the Walrus said,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"That they could get it clear?"
"I doubt it," said the Carpenter,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd shed a bitter tear.
"O Oysters, come and walk with us!"
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThe Walrus did beseech.
"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAlong the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊTo give a hand to each."
The eldest Oyster looked at him,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊBut never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd shook his heavy head Ñ
Meaning to say he did not choose
ÊÊÊÊÊÊTo leave the oyster-bed.
But four young Oysters hurried up,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAll eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊTheir shoes were clean and neat Ñ
And this was odd, because, you know,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThey hadn't any feet.
Four other Oysters followed them,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd more, and more, and more Ñ
All hopping through the frothy waves,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd scrambling to the shore.
The Walrus and the Carpenter
ÊÊÊÊÊÊWalked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
ÊÊÊÊÊÊConveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd waited in a row.
"The time has come," the Walrus said,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"To talk of many things:
Of shoes Ñ and ships Ñ and sealing-wax Ñ
ÊÊÊÊÊÊOf cabbages Ñ and kings Ñ
And why the sea is boiling hot Ñ
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd whether pigs have wings."
"But wait a bit," the Oysters cried,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd all of us are fat!"
"No hurry!" said the Carpenter.
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThey thanked him much for that.
"A loaf of bread," the Walrus said,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAre very good indeed Ñ
Now if you're ready, Oysters dear,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊWe can begin to feed."
"But not on us!" the Oysters cried,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊTurning a little blue.
"After such kindness, that would be
ÊÊÊÊÊÊA dismal thing to do!"
"The night is fine," the Walrus said.
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Do you admire the view?"
"It was so kind of you to come!
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd you are very nice!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Cut us another slice:
I wish you were not quite so deaf Ñ
ÊÊÊÊÊÊI've had to ask you twice!"
"It seems a shame," the Walrus said,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"To play them such a trick,
After we've brought them out so far,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd made them trot so quick!"
The Carpenter said nothing but
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"The butter's spread too thick!"
"I weep for you," the Walrus said:
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"I deeply sympathize."
With sobs and tears he sorted out
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThose of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
ÊÊÊÊÊÊBefore his streaming eyes.
"O Oysters," said the Carpenter,
ÊÊÊÊÊÊ"You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?"
ÊÊÊÊÊÊBut answer came there none Ñ
And this was scarcely odd, because
ÊÊÊÊÊÊThey'd eaten every one.
